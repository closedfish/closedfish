Ariel:
This week: 
          - Met with the switch team to run tests on the AI using the generator code.
	  - Looked into how to create test functions
	  - Started coding test functions for CFBoard.cpp
Next week:
	  - Continue writing test functions
	  - Continue working with the switch team to train the AI

Ba Cong:
This week:
	- Implement one-person DFS algorithm by moving towards positions closest to the heat map
	- Use the algorithm class provided by Rali to set up an architecture for communication between components of the project.
Next week:
	- Tweak the one-person DFS algorithm for better performance
	- Help the team doing two-people DFS algorithm

Etienne:
This week:
	- Continued working on and implementing the unit-tests for our algorithm.
	- Had more meetings with the members of the algorithm team to better understand its respective functions and conducted further research into more testing methods and syntax along with much trial-and-error.
Next week:
	- Continue working on the unit-tests.
	- Work on debugging the algorithm.

Aarrya 
This week: 
  1) Made a blueprint of the breakthrough algorithm 
  2) The original plan of the project has been done so new thought of new optimizations and features and rearranged teams accordingly
  3) Finalised how all algorithms will come together
Next week:
  1) Complete the breakthrough algorithm
  2) Start putting everything together 

Please also note that there was a problem with the git commit last week. The commit from last week can be seen in the begninning of this week.

Yoshimi-Theophile
Week 1: Started implementation of the ClosedFish board. Laid the groundwork for data representation.
  Implemented necessary functions to access this data in meaningful ways, as well as a way to visualize the current board.
Week 2: Highly optimized the Board class from the previous week by changing the way chess pieces' information is stored.
  Implemented the greater part of chess pieces' moves within the class (some work still to be done). 
  With the help of Sirawit, made the CFBoard class callable to make moves, and generally usable for others.
  Made docstrings for all methods.
Week 3: Added methods according to feedback, and lightly tested my ruleset code to suss out any errors.
Week 4: Optimized a large part of the process for getting legal moves in the board implementation.
  Moved my progress report to this most recent file instead of updating the old file every week (hopefully not a problem).
Week 5: Suggested changes to algorithm to the current iteration, and studied some of the repository. Will assist in the creation of DFS's next week.

Sirawit:
This week:
	- Did 2 meetings on resolving `TeamSwitchAI` branch and the breakthrough algorithmic structure.
	- (unfinished) Implement a function to evaluate a `CFBoard` using Stockfish naive evaluation.
Next week:
	- Continue the implementation.
	- Resolve `TeamSwitchAI`.
	- Help Yoshi and Aarrya on the breakthrough algorithm.

Shirelle: 
This week : 
	-went on meeting with other teams
	-work on creating functions to test other teams' algorithms 
Next week:
	-continue writing test functions 

Razvan:
This week:
	- Started working on piece recognition with dimitrije
	- (unfinished) Created a function to do Harris corner detetion
Next week:
	- Test efficiency and corectness of this, try out other methods
	- Create base measurments for the chess pieces
  
Antonia:

(Report from last week missing): Finshed to test the weak pawns functions and did the first pull-request of the branch Weak-Pawns.

This week :
	- As the newest version of CFBoard.cpp got merged over the vacation, I realized that CFBoard has some new member functions that overlap with my code and makes it much shorter. I ereased pretty much the whole old code and wrote a new one, more simple, shorter, and that uses the functions of CFBoard.cpp.
	- Tested the new version of WeakPawns.cpp and did a new pull-request.
	- Implemented functions that tell where the pieces can move in 1 or 2 moves. 

Next week:
 	- Finish basic testing for PieceMovements.cpp and hopefully merge.
	
New task : work on a function that selects the move that closes the position the most. The move it given by stockfish and we want to close the position in order to 
create a situation for closed fish algorithm.

Dimitrije:
This week:
Two implementations for board condition reading. Adapted the input and output for better connection with the rest of the code and worked on merging it.
Next week:
Come up with alternative to OpenCV native template matching functions and merge.


Nadja:
		This week
		-Help Andrei for 5 hours to work on breakthroughs in closed positions.
		-Study chess material and analyze closed positions
		-Clean-up my local branches
