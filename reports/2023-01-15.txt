Aarrya:
  This week:
    spent more time refining the algorithm idea and finalised it to a rough version of an alpha beta pruning
    wrote the code and almost completed it
  Next week:
    put everything together, debug, test, pray to god


Etienne:
This week:
	- Continued working on the Unit-Tests and almost finished them.
	- Started researching and looking into debugging for the algorithm.
Next week:
	- Finish all the Unit-Tests, debug and finish the algorithm.


Antonia:

This week:
	- in PieceMovement.cpp: implemented functiosn to detect blunders (to detect if we can eat any piece after the last opponent's moveÂ°. Since in closed positions no one should be able to take opponent pieces, if we suddenly can eat a piece it means that the opponent played badly).
	- in WeakPawns.cpp : implemented some more weak pawns functions for the needs of the 2-person dfs

Next week:
	- Fix bugs and merge
	- start thinking about the presentation


Ariel:
This week: 
	  - Coded test functions for CFBoard.cpp
Next week:
	  - Continue writing test functions
	  - Continue working with the switch team to train the AI
	  - Help Merge the project


Ba Cong:
This week:
	- Fixed the one person dfs when it goes to an infinite loop too early.
	- Optimized the one person dfs for higher depth.
	- Discovered bugs in naiveCheckCheck and CFBoard from testing with one person dfs, informed Sirawit and Yoshi to fix them afterwards.
Next week:
	- Finish the one person dfs and help out on other algorithms.
	- Help with building connectors between components of the project.

Cassidy:
This week:
	-Did statistical tests on the different regression bases I though of.
	-I first obtained the biase for each basis and found that it was close to zero therefore the data given to me was good to work with.
	-computed empirical quadratic risk for each basis and finally was able to chose a basis and therefore finalyse the implementation of the closeness ai: the square difference basis was the best in the end (confiremed my initial intution, though I am dissapointed the erf or arctan basis didn't work out :( )
Next week:
	-merge everything to main.
	-review implementation of the board representation and check with UI team that we agree on way of comunitation and also with the algo team.
	-make sure the Eigen library works with cmake on mac and windows (should be good but there a few bugs to fix.
	-prepare final presentation of the project.
	
Sirawit:
This week:
	- Finished Stockfish naive eval
	- Merged TeamSwitchAI pending PR
Next week:
	- Complete the Stockfish (and Closedfish) connector
	- Integrate unit tests from testing team

Nadja:
		This week:
		- Fixing compiling features 
		- Building optimizations
		- Fixing multithreading from cmake settings
		- Fixing CMake errors

Yoshimi-Theophile
Week 1: Started implementation of the ClosedFish board. Laid the groundwork for data representation.
  Implemented necessary functions to access this data in meaningful ways, as well as a way to visualize the current board.
Week 2: Highly optimized the Board class from the previous week by changing the way chess pieces' information is stored.
  Implemented the greater part of chess pieces' moves within the class (some work still to be done). 
  With the help of Sirawit, made the CFBoard class callable to make moves, and generally usable for others.
  Made docstrings for all methods.
Week 3: Added methods according to feedback, and lightly tested my ruleset code to suss out any errors.
Week 4: Optimized a large part of the process for getting legal moves in the board implementation.
  Moved my progress report to this most recent file instead of updating the old file every week (hopefully not a problem).
Week 5: Suggested changes to algorithm to the current iteration, and studied some of the repository.
Week 6: Implemented a helper function for blunder subsection of the algorithm. Participated in discussion about the project build
  and plans for connectors: the plan now is to build a master function for the algorithm, and put 2 weeks of discussion into effect.
