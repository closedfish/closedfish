Sirawit:
  This week:
    - Studied the connection between closedfish and the switch
    - Setup Git codebase (with Andrei)
    - Implemented a function to convert from closedfish board to stockfish board using FEN
  Next week:
    - Improve the structure of the codebase (with Andrei)
    - Study the output of stockfish go function
    - (if possible) Brainstorm/invent the data model to be used for evaluation
    - (if possible) Implement functionality to connect the output from stockfish to the switch

Aarrya:
- Organisde the entire work and made plans etc 
- provided a small skeleton for the representation
- started on the 1 person DFS 

Dimitrije:
This week:
-  Installed OpenCV after some issues, implemented test function to open image from file.
-  Wrote a program that opens a given image and finds the chess board, with a class storing each square of the board separately with coordinates on the screen. Everything was done using color recognition in the HVS basis. Classes are to be edited when merging with code that takes a screenshot.
Next week:
- Piece recognition and storing their position in a class.
- Merging with code that saves the current board screenshot.

Razvan:
This week:
- Created the main app
- Created a class that takes a screenshot form the primary monitor of the device and saves it as a bitmap (.bmp file)
- Addeed functions to send clicks for moving the pieces to that class
Next week:
- Detect chess pieces' movements
- Save the screenshot in differernt formats

Ariel
This Week: 
- Created the Chessboard Class with different functions which edit chessboards in different ways, retrieve information from chessboards as well as create chessboards
- Created the Element of a chessboard class, each element is initialised to (0,0) where the first number is the piece and the second is the colour
Next Week: 
- Continue coding the functions mainly inside the Chessboard class (generating Chessboards and determining openness and closeness of chessboards

Shirelle
- This week I worked with my subteam on creating some functions And definitions of the variables we are going to use, we have chosen each algorithm we wanted to work on. 
- Next week, I Will finish the algorithm that will output a chessboard with randomly chosen pawns. 

Rali 
This week : 
 - Started learning about the StockFish codebase
 - Started work on writing a class that connects our chess algorithm to the switch, in order to add an additional level of abstraction and normalize the data types.
Next week:
 - Finish the implementation of the connector class
 - Start working on a battery of tests of the performance of our algorithm.

Etienne
This week:
- Researched closed positions in chess for me and my team.
- Created the class representing the chess board, implemented the ArrayElement class with its respective functions to manipulate chessboard elements in collaboration with Ariel. Started work on file_generator. 
Next Week:
- Continue working on the Chessboard class and finish the closeness, openness functions and file_generator.


Antonia
This week:
- started the implementation of the functions that tell us by how many pieces the target pawn is currently protected (need to finalize the check for bishops and queens)
- adapted my code to Yoshi's board representation
Next week:
- check how many pieces can potentially protect the target pawn and in how many moves

Ba Cong
This week:
- Started implementing a heat map representing which square is the most important so that we know which square to priotize placing pieces on
- Added suggestions for creating a method to convert from a FEN to a CFBoard
Next week:
- Take relative piece values into account when updating the heat map
- Improve on the case where there are not a lot of free squares for pieces to maneuver easily.

Cassidy
This week:
-studied various reinforcement learning models to get more understanding on how the AI to find how closed a position is should be implemented. Also studied lots of chess to get a better understanding of what a closed, slightly closed... positions look like (not necessary but I'm trying to get more intuition on what I'm doing). -had the chance to implement a simple model that takes values such that there cloud is at least some one linear so it can simply predict outcomes.
-did research on Alpha-beta pruning and methods to make chess ai (Quite complicated to get full grasp of everything for now)
Next week:
-Get much better understanding of alpha-beta pruning implementation.
-try implementing AIs that are still based on reinforcement learning and that are more complex to aproach the complexity of the chess board.


Yoshimi-Theophile
Week 1: Started implementation of the ClosedFish board. Laid the groundwork for data representation.
  Implemented necessary functions to access this data in meaningful ways, as well as a way to visualize the current board.
Week 2: Highly optimized the Board class from the previous week by changing the way chess pieces' information is stored.
  Implemented the greater part of chess pieces' moves within the class (some work still to be done). 
  With the help of Sirawit, made the CFBoard class callable to make moves, and generally usable for others.
  Made docstrings for all methods.
Week 3: Added methods according to feedback, and lightly tested my ruleset code to suss out any errors.
Week 4 plan: heavily optimization-focused, will try to implement rulesets deterministically.

Week three plan: Keep adding functionalities that are missing (currently castle and pawn promotion come to mind).
  Adapt the class to fit user needs and feedback from other group members.
  Start optimizing and testing the existing code.

Andrei:
This week:
-build project structure with cmake
-help others with debugging
